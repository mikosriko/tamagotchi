# Tamagotchi
One of my OpenFrameworks assignments during second year where I had to make a working Tamagotchi.

## Instructions
Download the **"bin"** folder and run the **"tamagotchi_debug.exe"** file.

Take care of your tamagotchi by feeding, putting to bed, washing, and playing with it. Trying to overfeed for example will decrease other stats. They will die if not taken care of properly. 

## Controls
- **Feed**  = Q
- **Sleep** = W
- **Wash**  = E
- **Play**  = R

Have fun!
