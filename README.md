# Tamagotchi
One of my OpenFrameworks assignments during second year where I had to make a working Tamagotchi.

Take care of your tamagotchi by feeding, putting to bed, washing, and playing with it. Trying to overfeed for example will decrease other stats. They will die if not taken care of properly. 

## Instructions
To run it, download the **"bin"** folder and run the **"tamagotchi_debug.exe"** file.

Going through the project itself requires you to download Openframeworks at [https://openframeworks.cc/download/](https://openframeworks.cc/download/).

There will be a project generator which will create all the necessary files for you when including a folder that contains:
- bin
- src
- addons.make

## Controls
- **Feed**  = Q
- **Sleep** = W
- **Wash**  = E
- **Play**  = R

Have fun!
